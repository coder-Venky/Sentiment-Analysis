# Sentiment Analysis

## Introduction
The **Sentiment Analysis** project is a Python-based application that analyzes the sentiment of text data. It categorizes text as positive, negative, or neutral using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This project can be used for analyzing customer feedback, social media comments, and product reviews.

## Features
- Classifies text sentiment as **positive, negative, or neutral**
- Supports multiple data sources (CSV, JSON, live text input)
- Uses machine learning and NLP techniques
- Provides visualization of sentiment distribution (if using Matplotlib/Seaborn)
- Can be extended to support real-time sentiment tracking

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Primary language)
- **NLTK / TextBlob / VADER** (For text processing and sentiment analysis)
- **scikit-learn** (For ML-based sentiment classification)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (For data handling)
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (For data visualization, optional)

## Installation Guide
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis.git
   cd sentiment-analysis
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python sentiment_analysis.py
   ```

## How to Use
1. Provide text input via command line, a file, or a dataset.
2. The model will analyze the sentiment and categorize it as **positive, negative, or neutral**.
3. (Optional) View sentiment distribution graphs if visualization is enabled.

## Configuration Details
- **ML Model**: The project can be extended to use pre-trained models such as BERT for more accurate sentiment classification.
- **Dataset Handling**: Modify `sentiment_analysis.py` to process data from different file formats.
